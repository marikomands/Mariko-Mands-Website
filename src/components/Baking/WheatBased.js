One of my hobbies is baking.  Especially, I like to bake bread.  It is always heaven to smell the freshly based bread.  
I usually make Japanese style fluffy bread as my children like them.  They love Anpan which is round bread filled with read bean paste sesame seeds on top. 
Some people say that kneading is too much trouble and not bothered to do it.  In my case, I don't feel the same as long as I have enough time for myself for that. 
I enjoy the kneading process as a part of bread making.
