      <p>
        Gluten Free bread could be sometimes very hard and not fluffy like
        regular bread. After experiencing many gluten free bread making, I have
        came up with the recipies of the best gluten free bread. Also, I have
        noticed many differencebetween Japanese and Western gluten free bread
        recipies. In japan, we mainly use rice flour for gluten free bread (yes,
        Japanese people love rice very much!) Unlike western recipies, the
        recipies don't inclde any eggs. white eggs are full of protein and tend
        to make a bread hard, so it might be because of that.
