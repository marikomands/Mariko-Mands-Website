      <p>
        One of my goals every day is not to take gluten as much as possible as I
        believe gluten could cause the damage to your stomach and skin.
        (Although I often have cheat daysðŸ’¦) Gluten Free bread could be
        sometimes very hard and not fluffy like regular bread. After
        experiencing many gluten free bread making, I have came up with the
        recipies of the best gluten free bread. Also, I have noticed many
        difference between Japanese and Western gluten free bread recipies. In
        japan, we mainly use rice flour for gluten free bread (yes, Japanese
        people love rice very much!) Unlike western recipies, the recipies don't
        inclde any eggs. white eggs are full of protein and tend to make a bread
        hard, so it might be why we tend not to use it in Japan as many Japanese
        people like fluffy bread.
